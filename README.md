# READ THIS README BEFORE OPENING FILES

Juno will be doing the Pig.java

You will be working with a partner to practice technical interviews. One person will present (be the interviewer) for Sponge. One person will present (be the interviewer) for Pig.


## Step 1
**Decide with your partner who will present which question now**

DO NOT YET LOOK AT ANY OF THE FILES in `src`

## Step 2
Each of you should separately fork and clone this repository. You should each have your own fork.

DO NOT YET LOOK AT ANY OF THE FILES in `src`

## Step 3 
Take 10 minutes to separately each look at the solution for the question you are going to present.

If you are going to present Sponge, look at `SpongeSolution.java`
If you are going to present Pig, look at `PigSolution.java`

DO NOT LOOK AT THE FILES FOR THE OTHER QUESTION.

Read through the solution. Understand the question that is being asked, and how the sample solution works. Look at the notes to the interviewer at the bottom. This will give you suggestions on how to answer your partner's questions or help them if they are getting stuck.

## Step 4
After 10 minutes, choose one person to be interviewer first. 

Prepare a timer for 30 minutes, but do not start it yet.

Open the question on the candidate's computer. For example, if you are presenting (are the interviewer for) Sponge, then your partner (the candidate) should open `Sponge.java` on their computer. Both partners should look at the candidate's computer together throughout the interview.

The interviewer should read the question out loud to the candidate. Once the interviewer is done reading, start the timer.

During the interview, the following is allowed:
- Running the code
- Adding print statements
- Asking the interviewer questions
- Using web searches to search for Java syntax (e.g "how to convert a character to uppercase Java")

DO NOT USE AI AT ANY POINT

## Step 5 (Once time is up)
Once the 30 minute timer goes off, stop the interview, regardless of how much progress was made. It is OK and expected not to finish! Take a short (5-10 minute) break. Then switch roles and do the interview for the other question.

## Step 6
After both partners have gone, submit the short post-interview survey on Canvas. This is how you will get credit. It should take only a minute or two to complete, please complete it today.

## Step 7
If you did not finish your problem, please complete it for homework. Make a PR against the original repo and submit a link to your PR on Canvas. You can optionally implement the other problem on your own if you want extra practice.
